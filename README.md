# mcp-khal

An MCP server that lets an assistant read and create events in your [khal](https://github.com/pimutils/khal) calendars.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `list_calendars` | List the configured calendars | — |
| `list_events` | List events in a date range (default: today + 7 days) | `range?`, `calendar?` |
| `events_in_range` | List all events intersecting a time range | `start`, `end`, `calendar?` |
| `search_events` | Search events by text | `query`, `calendar?` |
| `new_event` | Create an event or a recurring series | `start`, `end?`, `summary`, `calendar?`, `location?`, `description?`, `alarm?`, `recurrence?` |

### Recurring events
`recurrence` is `{ pattern, ending? }`. For a series, `start` must be `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` (the first occurrence, which must match the pattern), `end` is a required `HH:MM`, and times are local.

`pattern` is one of:
- `{ "kind": "daily", "interval"?: n }`
- `{ "kind": "weekly", "interval"?: n, "weekdays": [...] }`
- `{ "kind": "monthly_day", "interval"?: n, "day": 1-31 }`
- `{ "kind": "monthly_weekday", "interval"?: n, "nth": 1-4 | -1, "weekday": "..." }`
- `{ "kind": "yearly", "interval"?: n }`

`ending` is `{ "kind": "never" }`, `{ "kind": "count", "count": n }` or `{ "kind": "until", "date": "YYYY-MM-DD" }`.

Example, every 2nd Wednesday of the month: `{ "pattern": { "kind": "monthly_weekday", "nth": 2, "weekday": "wednesday" } }`.

## Usage
```
npm install && npm run build
```
MCP client config:
```json
{ "mcpServers": { "khal": { "command": "node", "args": ["/path/to/mcp-khal/dist/cli.js"] } } }
```

## Setup (not a tool)
```
npm run setup        # or: node dist/cli.js setup
```
Lists your khal calendars and asks for your email address on each. The mapping (calendar name → address) is saved to `~/.config/mcp-khal.json` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `$MCP_KHAL_CONFIG` are honoured). Existing entries are prefilled (editable) on each line; otherwise a calendar whose name is an email address is prefilled with that name. Submit blank on an empty line to skip. Rerun any time.
